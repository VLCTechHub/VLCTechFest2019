## How to use

Ruby required. You must use the Github Pages Gem bundled Jekyll in order to make it work properly: 

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

## Multilingual Jekyll

Based on https://github.com/sylvaindurand/jekyll-multilingual. For more info visit  the [**Making Jekyll multilingual**](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/) article

## Adding a new community

When adding a new community, there are two steps that need to be done:

1. Add the community logo (preferably in SVG format) to `images/communities/`
2. Modify the `_data/communities.yaml` file, with the next fields: `name`, `image` (the logo image name, with no path) and `links`: a list of social media links.

## Theme

Original theme created over the [Jekyll default theme](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new).
