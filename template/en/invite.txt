Hi [name],

#VLCTechFest2019 will take place on the 11th of May at Las Naves Innovation Center in Valencia. The festival of the technological communities of the Valencian Community! It will be an awesome day to meet the communities. I'm sure we don't know most of them and we can join some of them. Or maybe we meet people with common interests to create a new community, who knows!

They are looking for sessions or talks directed at a technical audience, without requiring detailed prior knowledge of the technology or specific tool in question. Only 30 minutes! And then there are until 15 minutes for Q&A and other 15 minutes to move to another track. If you don't know to answer a question, don't worry, ask audience for help. It's about sharing!

Furthermore, the event includes a code of conduct, to ensure the event goes off without incident and that everybody is welcome.

[name], I think you could submit a proposal for this event. [reason]

The event organization provides help to prepare the talk, but I'm here as well for giving you feedback. It's a great opportunity, [name]! Preparing a talk provides awesome reflection moments and it's useful to learn more and more. Attendees will ask you questions which will provide you other perspectives. Don't miss this opportunity, [name]!

You can submit your proposal in this link: https://goo.gl/forms/Xa2ikyc8Gt9bxsRt1

And you have time until the 11th of March. Let me know if I can help you!
